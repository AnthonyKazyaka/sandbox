## üí° Project-Specific Tips

### to-do-tracker Development
- **State Management**: App uses class-based state management in `app.js`
- **Theming**: CSS custom properties in `:root` for easy theme switching
- **Data Flow**: localStorage ‚Üí JavaScript objects ‚Üí DOM rendering
- **Architecture**: Modular components ready for framework migration

### Common Patterns
```javascript
// Task creation pattern
const task = {
    id: this.generateId(),
    title: taskData.title,
    // ... other properties
    createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
    updatedAt: new Date().toISOString()
};

// Theme switching pattern
document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', theme);
document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-scheme', scheme);

// Toast notification pattern
this.showToast('Task created!', 'success');
```

## üöÄ Quick Start Commands

### Setting up Development Environment
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd to-do-tracker

# Start local server (Python)
python -m http.server 8000

# Or with Node.js
npx serve .

# Or with PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

### Common Development Tasks
```javascript
// Debug localStorage
console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('familyTrackerData')));

// Reset application data
localStorage.removeItem('familyTrackerData');
location.reload();

// Test PWA installation
// Use Chrome DevTools > Application > Manifest
```
